# Hey there...
I'm just starting to get into programming and IT. At the moment I'm focussing on the basics (I want this ComptIA A+ Certificate! :D), but on the way I'm also learning Mobile Development mainly with Flutter for my upcoming new job.
My Projects up till now are only simple training-projects from tutorials and stuff... But I hope I will be able to tackle more complex ideas in the not-so-far future. Until then, have a good day!

P.S.: I love hyenas! ;)

P.P.S.: When I tried to commit my last changes, I had to realize, that the Ghostery-Addon for firefox for some reason interferes with the site somehow and doesn't let me commit any changes. Strange thing.
