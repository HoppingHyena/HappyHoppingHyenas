# HappyHoppingHyenas
Just random stuff and a little bit about me.

I'm a little hyena who wants to learn about programming. :)
I want to start with web development (html, css, JavaScript) so that I can build nice little websites for my hyena buddys and than I'll see where the mood is taking me from there ... :D
Cheers!
